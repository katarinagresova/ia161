# Extracting structured information from text

Information extraction (IE) is a technology based on analyzing natural language in order to extract snippets of information. The process takes texts (and sometimes speech) as input and produces fixed-format, unambiguous data as output. This data may be used directly for display to users, or may be stored in a database or spreadsheet for later analysis, or may be used for indexing purposes in information retrieval (IR) applications such as Internet search engines like Google.
