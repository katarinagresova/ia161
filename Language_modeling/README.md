# Language modeling

The goal of a language model is to assign a score to any possible input sentence. In the past, this was achieved mainly by n-gram models known since WWII. But recently, the buzzword deep learning penetrated also into language modelling and it turned out to be substantially better than Markov's n-gram models.
The current state of the art models are build on neural networks using transformers.
