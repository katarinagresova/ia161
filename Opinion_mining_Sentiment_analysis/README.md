# Opinion mining, sentiment analysis

Sentiment analysis can be seen as a text categorization task (i.e. is the writer's opinion on a discussed topic X or Y?). It consists of detection of the topic (which can be easy in focused reviews) and detection of the sentiment (which is generally difficult). Opinions are sometimes expressed in a very subtle manner (e.g. the sentence How could anyone sit through this movie? contains no negative word) [3]. The sentiments are usually simply classified by their polarity (positive, negative) but they can be recognized more in depth (e.g. strongly negative). Recognized opinions are also subject to summarization (e.g. how many people like this new iPhone design?).
