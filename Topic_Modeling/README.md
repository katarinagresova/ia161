# Topic identification, topic modelling

Topic modeling is a statistical approach for discovering abstract topics hidden in text documents. A document usually consists of multiple topics with different weights. Each topic can be described by typical words belonging to the topic. The most frequently used methods of topic modeling are Latent Semantic Analysis and Latent Dirichlet Allocation.
