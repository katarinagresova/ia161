# Stylometry

The analysis of author's characteristic writing style and vocabulary has been used to uncover author's traits such as authorship, age, or gender documents by both manual linguistic approaches and automatic algorithmic methods.

The most common approach to stylometry problems is to combine stylistic analysis with machine learning techniques:
 - specific style markers are extracted,
 - a classification procedure is applied to extracted markers
